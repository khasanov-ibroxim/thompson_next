    "one_title": "First Generation: Dyed Film",
    "one": "The first generation of window tint films consisted of dyed polyester film. Dye was added during the manufacturing process, giving the film a dark tint. However, this technology had significant drawbacks: the dye would fade over time when exposed to ultraviolet radiation, leading to color changes in the film.",

    "two_title": "Second Generation: Metallized Film",
    "two": "The second generation emerged through the technology of depositing a thin layer of metal onto a polyester base. This significantly improved the protective properties of the film: it better reflected sunlight and heat. Metallized films were more durable compared to dyed films, but had their drawbacks - they could create interference with radio signals.",

    "three_title": "Third Generation: Ceramic Film",
    "three": "The third generation was a real breakthrough. Ceramic films use ceramic nanoparticles instead of metal. This provides superior protection against ultraviolet radiation (up to 99%) and infrared heat (up to 90%) without creating interference with electronic devices. Ceramic films don't fade, don't change color, and have high durability.",

    "four_title": "Fourth Generation: Nano-Ceramic",
    "four": "The fourth generation represents an advanced ceramic technology using even smaller nanoparticles. This allows creating films with improved optical properties, providing maximum transparency while maintaining all protective characteristics. Thompson nano-ceramic films block up to 99% of UV rays and up to 95% of infrared heat.",

    "five_title": "Fifth Generation: Smart Films",
    "five": "The fifth generation consists of intelligent multilayer systems combining multiple technologies. They include nano-ceramic layers, special light-reflecting coatings, and protective layers working synergistically. These films provide maximum protection, comfort, and durability, while also having the ability to adapt to various lighting conditions.",

    "six_title": "Future: Adaptive Smart Films",
    "six": "The sixth generation is under development and represents adaptive smart films capable of automatically changing their properties depending on external conditions. Such films will be able to regulate light and heat transmission levels, providing optimal comfort at any time of day and in any weather. Thompson is already working on these innovative solutions."
